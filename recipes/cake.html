    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package German chocolate cake mix</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>2 cups hot fudge topping</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed</li>
        <li>4 (1.4 ounce) bars English toffee-flavored candy, crushed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step</li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.</p>
        <li>Step</li>
        <p>Mix cake mix, water, oil, and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</p>
        <li>Step</li>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and set the baking dish on a wire rack.</p>
        <li>Step</li>
        <p>While the cake is still very warm, poke holes all over the top with the end of a wooden spoon. Pour condensed milk over cake and let cool, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step</li>
        <p>Pour hot fudge topping over cooled cake and let set, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step</li>
        <p>Spread whipped topping over top and sprinkle with crushed toffee.</p>
